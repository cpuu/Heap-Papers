## Heap Exploitation Techniques

| Name | Description | Reference |
|---|:---|---:|
|`Fast bin dup` | Corrupting a fast bin freelist (e.g., by double free or write-after-free) to return an arbitrary location |---:|
|  `Unsafe unlink` | Abusing unlinking in a freelist to get arbitrary write |---:|
| `House of spirit` | Freeing a fake chunk of fast bin to return arbitrary location |---:|
| `Poison null byte` |  Corrupting heap chunk size to consolidate chunks even in the presence of allocated heap |---:|
| `House of lore` | Abusing the small bin freelist to return an arbitrary location |---:|
| `Overlapping chunks` |  Corrupting a chunk size in the unsorted bin to overlap with an allocated heap |---:|
| `House of force` |  Corrupting the top chunk to return an arbitrary location |---:|
| `Unsorted bin attack` | Corrupting a freed chunk in unsorted bin to write a uncontrollable value to arbitrary location  |---:|
|`House of einherja` |Corrupting PREV_IN_USE to consolidate chunks to return an arbitrary location that requires a heap address |[14]|
|`Unsorted bin into stack` |  Abusing the unsorted freelist to return an arbitrary location |[16]|
|`House of unsorted einherjar` | A variant of house of einherjar that does not require a heap address  |[16]|
|`Unaligned double free` | Corrupting a small bin freelist to return already allocated heap  |[16]|
|`Overlapping small chunks` |  Corrupting a chunk size in a small bin to overlap chunks |[16]|
|`Fast bin into other bin` | Corrupting a fast bin freelist and use malloc_consolidate() to return an arbitrary non-fast-bin chunk |[16]|
